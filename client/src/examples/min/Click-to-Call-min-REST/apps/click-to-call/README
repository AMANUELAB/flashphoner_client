Here you can see a set of REST-methods for Click-to-Call implementation:
- call
- CallStatusEvent
- connect
- ConnectionStatusEvent
- RegistrationStatusEvent

1. Edit connect.json and call.json files with your custom settings.

2. Make sure that these URLs are opening via web-browser:

http://your-web-host/click-to-call/connect
http://your-web-host/click-to-call/ConnectionStatusEvent
http://your-web-host/click-to-call/RegistrationStatusEvent
http://your-web-host/click-to-call/CallStatusEvent
http://your-web-host/click-to-call/call

See .htaccess rewrite rules for more information.

3. Create new application 'click2call' with appKey 'click2call'.

Set REST URL 'http://your-web-host/click-to-call' for this app.
See Admin Guide CLI Documentation for more info.

That's all.
You can use click-to-call with minimal configuration.

Don't forget to restrict public access to your json files.
